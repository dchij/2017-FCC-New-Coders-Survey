# 2017-FCC-New-Coders-Survey

In this project, we assume that we're working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement.

Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.

To avoid spending money on organizing a survey, we'll first try to make use of existing data to determine whether we can reach any reliable result.

One good candidate for our purpose is freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey. freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a popular Medium publication (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.
